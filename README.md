# Slot-Machine-Game

## Running the program:
Main.py is the main program file which contains all the necesary code to run the game. 

### Requirements: 
Program requires tkinter and pygame file to be installed for it to run.

The oldPorgram is just an illustration of the changes made over time and allows me to see the starting and endpoint of the program (can ignore that file).

How it will work:
- User deposits a certain amount of money
- Bet 1, 2, 3 lines on the slot machine
- If they got any lines we're going to multiply their bet by the value of the line
- Add to their balance and let them continue playing until they lose their money or cash out

Tasks involved:
- Need to collect the users deposit
- Add to their balance
- Allow them to bet on a line or multiple line
- Check if they got any lines
- Need to spin the slot machine
- Generate different items that are going to be in the slot machine on the different reels
- Add money won back to their balance
